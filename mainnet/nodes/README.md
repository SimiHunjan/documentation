# Nodes

Hedera networks are comprised of two types of nodes: Consensus and Mirror nodes. The Hedera mainnet **consensus nodes** are currently permissioned; operated by the Hedera Governing Council. Consensus nodes receive transactions from clients, charge transaction fees, and contribute to consensus being achieved. **Mirror nodes** are permisionless, and store the history of transactions for optimized queries. Mirror nodes do not submit transactions to the network from clients nor do they participate in consensus**.**
