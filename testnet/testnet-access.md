# Testnet Access

You will need a Hedera testnet account to interact with and pay for any of the network services \(cryptocurrency, file service, and smart contracts\). Your Hedera testnet account is what holds a balance of hbar to be used for transfers to other accounts or payments for network services.

### Create Hedera Portal Profile

To create your Hedera Portal profile register [here](https://portal.hedera.com/register) and complete your profile.

Once you've completed setting up your profile, your home page will automatically create a testnet account and generate the public and private key pair associated with it. You can easily copy your accountId, public key, and private key information to your clipboard to use when configuring your SDK environment for testnet. The "NETWORK" section contains the node ID and node address of testnet nodes that can be configured in your application to submit transactions
